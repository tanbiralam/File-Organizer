# File Organizer

## Overview
This is a simple Python script that organizes files within a specified folder based on their file extensions. It moves files into respective subdirectories corresponding to their extensions.

## Features
- **User-friendly interface:** Simply input the directory path of the folder you want to organize.
- **Automatic organization:** Files are sorted into subdirectories based on their extensions.
- **Error handling:** Provides feedback in case of invalid directory paths or other errors.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the script to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
5. Run the script by executing the following command:

```bash
python file_organizer.py

```

6. Follow the prompts to enter the directory path of the folder you want to organize.
7. The script will organize the files within the folder automatically.

## Example
Suppose you have a folder named "Downloads" containing various files with different extensions. After running the script, the files will be organized into subdirectories based on their extensions within the "Downloads" folder.

For example:
- Files with the ".txt" extension will be moved to a "txt" subdirectory.
- Files with the ".jpg" extension will be moved to a "jpg" subdirectory.
- And so on.

## Note
- Make sure to enter the correct directory path when prompted.
- The script does not modify the original files; it only moves them to organized subdirectories.
